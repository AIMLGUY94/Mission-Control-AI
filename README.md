# Mission Control AI

## Overview

Mission Control AI is an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed for mission-critical decision making. Built with GPT-5 and LanceDB, it dynamically retrieves and reasons over your own documents — PDFs, URLs, and more — to deliver trusted, confidence-scored insights.

This open-source project features:

- Document retrieval with semantic search
- Confidence scoring and missing information flagging
- Streamlit-based user interface for easy interaction
- Extensible architecture with the Agno framework for agent orchestration
